Silhouette Score: This score ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating that the clusters are well apart from each other and clearly distinguished, 0 indicating that the clusters are indifferent, or we can say that the distance between clusters is not significant, and -1 indicating that the clusters are incorrect or samples have been assigned to the wrong clusters.

Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI): The lower the DBI, the better. It signifies that the clusters are dense and well-separated. A value closer to 0 indicates a better partition. 

Remember, clustering is an iterative process and often requires experimentation to find the best parameters. ðŸ˜Š
