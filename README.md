# CodeAlpha_Music_Recommendation_System

This project is about building a music recommendation system using machine learning. The system predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe. It uses a dataset where 1 indicates repeated plays within a month. The system tracks user song histories and timestamps to generate personalized song recommendations.

## Libraries Used
