Both t-SNE and PCA are techniques used for dimensionality reduction, which is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. The choice between t-SNE and PCA depends on the specific characteristics of your data and what you want to achieve with the dimensionality reduction.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis):

PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique.
It tries to preserve the global structure of the data.
PCA is computationally less expensive than t-SNE, especially for large datasets.
PCA is deterministic, meaning it will always produce the same output when given the same input.
PCA does not involve hyperparameters, making it simpler to use.
PCA works by rotating the vectors for preserving variance.
t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding):

t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.
It tries to preserve the local structure (cluster) of data.
t-SNE is one of the best dimensionality reduction techniques for visualization purposes.
t-SNE involves hyperparameters such as perplexity, learning rate, and number of steps.
t-SNE can handle outliers.
t-SNE is a non-deterministic or randomized algorithm, meaning it can produce different outputs when run multiple times on the same data.
t-SNE works by minimizing the distance between the point in a Gaussian.

In summary, if your primary goal is to visualize clusters in your data, t-SNE may be the better choice. However, if youâ€™re dealing with a very large dataset and computational resources or time are a concern, PCA might be more appropriate. Additionally, if you want to understand the importance of different features, PCA is a better choice because it provides a clear ranking of feature importance, something t-SNE does not provide.
